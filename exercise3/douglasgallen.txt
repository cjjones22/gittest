"some details about yourself" he he. I'm just being funny I hope. Mabey more like silly indeed. Possibly mad. Maybe.

I guess that I just can't follow directions or something. The directions said:

"Write some details about yourself in this file."

Maybe there was a small bug on the screen at the time. I could have sworn it said:

"Write, some details about yourself, in this file." Maybe there were two bugs?

Maybe I need to get my eyes checked. It's been over four years. Now I'm not kidding.

And these darn bifocals give me neck straign because I have to look down while I look up.

Silly invention those are. That may be ok for driving a vehicle but not for these new fangled machines.

Okay. I'm done ranting about silliness. Have fun with the text machines all.

P.S. Reading "On Golden Thread" was fun. But I should have studied more code and not worried about philosophy as much.
The Escher prints were cool though. Now that's art. Kind of reminds me of Wye or Why or RG or whomever that Blix the cat man is or was or whatever.
