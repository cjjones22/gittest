Hi, I'm an automation developer at IBM and our team is using git.
I love music, woods, running, skiing, playing flute, guitar, piano. 
I host a jam session every year at Cranberry Lake called 
Cranberry Jam and race at Cranberry Scram. 
I also love Ruby and Rails so in my spare time when I'm not
coding or playing music or woodsing I'm playing with code related to music 
and camping.
My RoR applications for campground administration and music festival 
volunteering are at cranberryjam.ca
I live in Ottawa with my son Nick, 24, husband Bill (married last summer at
CranberryJam), our cat Crystal and parrot Mac.
